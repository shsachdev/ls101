# we will let 0 represent that the light is off, and 1 represent that the light is on

# we have initialized a hash with each light being on.

#Â now, we must iterate through this hash
  # if hash_key.index is divisible by the divisor, then toggle. if not, don't toggle.
  # then augment the divisor by 1 (keep doing this until we have reached total)
# then return the number of 1s in the array.
