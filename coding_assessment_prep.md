Understand the Problem
  - requirements are explicit
    - take notes
    - the odd words problem
  - requirements are not so explicit and need to be modelled
    - requirements are shown with examples
      - examples need to be described in computational words
      - diamond of stars
    - implicit knowledge needs to be captured.
      - convert to explicit rules, in computational language.
      - what century is that
    - identifying and defining important terms and concepts
