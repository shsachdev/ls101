# Rational number == any number that can represented as the result of the divison
# between two integers (1/3, 22/7)

# Unit Fraction == a rational number where the numerator is 1.

# egyptian fraction == sum of a series of distinct unit fractions.

# Write two methods: one that takes a Rational number as an argument, and returns
# an Array of the denominators that are part of an Egyptian Fraction representation
# of the number, and another that takes an Array of numbers in the same format,
# and calculates the resulting Rational number. You will need to use the Rational class
# provided by Ruby.
